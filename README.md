<h2>
Project background and context
</h2>

 <h4>
Unleash the power of data and analytics to increase revenue, find new business opportunities and learn more about player behavior.

<h2>
Problems I'm going to solve as a Data Scientist
</h2>

<h4>
 
1. Promoting the game to draw more users from iOS and Mac. High Rollers who    are willing to spend 
   more are more likely to play on these two platforms.


2. Concentrate on marketing and creating in-app purchase items like itemID 5,  which is the most  
   lucrative one.

3. By promoting the most influential players, they could quickly draw in the neighborhood.
